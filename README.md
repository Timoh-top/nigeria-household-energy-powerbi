# nigeria-household-energy-powerbi
‚ÄúAdvanced Power BI dashboard analyzing Nigeria‚Äôs household energy consumption and emissions.‚Äù
# Project Overview
This project analyzes monthly household energy consumption across Nigerian states using Power BI, focusing on:
Identifying consumption patterns across states.
Estimating monthly electricity costs based on realistic tariffs.
Calculating estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions based on consumption.
Visualizing energy efficiency adoption rates.

# Data
Data Source: Realistic data aligned with NERC tariffs, World Bank/IEA energy consumption ranges, and CO‚ÇÇ emission factors.

# Parameters: 
State, Monthly energy consumption (kWh), Estimated monthly electricity cost (‚Ç¶), Estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions (kg), Energy efficiency adoption
#  Dashboard Features
Clean, interactive Power BI dashboard with:
Cards summarizing total consumption, cost, emissions.
Map visualization showing consumption across states.
Bar and scatter charts for state-level analysis.
Slicers for dynamic filtering by state or efficiency adoption.

#  Professional color coding:
üîµ Blue for consumption, üî¥ Red for emissions, üü¢ Green for efficiency.

# Key Insights
States with higher energy consumption contribute more to CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
Efficiency adoption has the potential to reduce emissions and costs.
Visual data-driven insights can guide policy, education, and individual action.

# Files Included
Nigeria_Real_Household_Energy.csv: The cleaned dataset for analysis.

Nigeria_Household_Energy_Dashboard.pbix: Power BI file with visuals.
